# sand

Self-hosted macOS CI Runners powered by Tart - Apple's Virtualization framework.

## Requirements

- macOS 15+ running on Apple Silicon machines.
- Tart installed and available in PATH
- sand uses tart. it helps understanding tart before using sand (https://tart.run/quick-start/)

## Caveats

macOS DHCP leases last 24 hours by default, causing IP exhaustion if you run more than ~253 VMs per day. To reduce lease time to 10 minutes:

```
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.InternetSharing.default.plist bootpd -dict DHCPLeaseTimeSecs -int 600
```

## Install

```
brew tap khoi/sand
brew install sand
```

## Usage

```
sand run --config config.yml
sand destroy --config config.yml
sand run --dry-run --config config.yml
```

## Local test suite

To run the local bash e2e tests (no CI):

```
./Tests/run
```

These tests spin up real VMs and require `tart`, `ssh`, and `sshpass` on your machine. See `Tests/README.md` for environment overrides (image, timeout, SSH creds, etc).

## Start up on boot

Create your config at `~/sand.yml`, then:

```
brew services start sand
```

Logs are written to `~/Library/Logs/sand.log` and `~/Library/Logs/sand.err.log`. Manage the service with:

```
brew services stop sand
brew services restart sand
brew services info sand
```

Note: this runs as a per-user LaunchAgent, which starts at login — enable automatic login on a headless runner so sand starts on machine boot.

## Logs

sand logs to macOS default logging system using `os_log`. To see the log

```
log show --predicate "subsystem == \"sand\"" --last 1h --info --debug
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "sand"' --debug --info --style compact --color always
```

You can also write logs to a file:

```
sand run --config config.yml --log-file /tmp/sand.log
```

## Configuration

Create a `config.yml` and run the CLI with `--config`. 

### GitHub Actions setup

1) Create a GitHub App and grant `Self-hosted runners` permission set to `Read & Write` at the organization level. https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app
2) Install the app on the organization or the specific repository you want to run against.
3) Download the private key and set `appId`, `organization`, `repository` (optional), and `privateKeyPath` in your config.

### GitHub Actions runner provisioner
```
runners:
  - name: runner-1
    vm:
      source:
        type: oci
        image: ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-runner:tahoe
      cache:
        host: ~/.cache/sand/actions-runner
    provisioner:
      type: github
      config:
        appId: 123456
        organization: my-org
        repository: my-repo
        privateKeyPath: ~/my-app.private-key.pem
        runnerName: runner-1
    healthCheck:
      command: "pgrep -fl /Users/admin/actions-runner/run.sh"
      interval: 30
      delay: 60
```

To enable runner caching, set `vm.cache`. The host downloads the Actions runner tarball, verifies its SHA-256 against the digest published by the GitHub releases API, stores it in `vm.cache.host` alongside a `.sha256` sidecar file, and delivers it into each VM over scp. Guests never download the runner and have no access to the cache directory, so a compromised job cannot poison it. The cache keeps the 5 newest runner versions; older ones are pruned automatically.

Sand resolves the latest Actions runner version via the GitHub API and re-checks at most once a day. If the API is unreachable, sand falls back to the newest verified tarball in the cache. Without `vm.cache`, the tarball is downloaded and verified on every boot.

Notes:
- `vm.cache.host` must be a directory (missing paths are created; file paths are rejected).
- `vm.cache` is ignored unless the provisioner type is `github`.
- `vm.cache.name` is deprecated and ignored.

### Custom provisioner script

```
runners:
  - name: runner-1
    vm:
      source:
        type: oci
        image: "ghcr.io/cirruslabs/ubuntu:latest"
      hardware:
        ramGb: 4
      ssh:
        user: admin
        password: admin
        port: 22
    provisioner:
      type: script
      config:
        run: |
          echo "Hello World" && sleep 10
    healthCheck:
      command: "true"
```

If `healthCheck` is omitted, sand runs `echo healthcheck` every 30s after a 60s delay.
